## Gesture elicitation as a computational optimization problem

The repository contains the following folders:
- *gelicop*: implementation (R code) of main methods.
- *training*: synthetic datasets to be used for analysis or for training predictive models (see *gelicopt/prediction.R*). 
They have been generated using the Hungarian algorithm over a large number of simulated studies. 
- *datasets*: datasets used for our case studies

For further information about how to use the code, please visit our project page at [gelicopt.github.io](http://gelicopt.github.io)
